# Calculator
Calculator Project from Stanford's iTunes U Course "Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift"

Hello and welcome to my first project in Swift. I've never really used Xcode before and I am just starting out in 
Swift so I thought I would make my Calculator project live on GitHub for anyone to download and take a look at when
they feel like it.
